# Net Event eBPF Extension (neteventebpfext)

## Introduction

Thi extension provides a way to capture network events generated from kernel components using eBPF. The extension is built on top of
the [eBPF for Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows), as per the [eBPF Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/eBpfExtensions.md) model,
and leverages the library files from this repo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- eBPF for Windows must be installed. Please follow the instructions in the [eBPF for Windows - Getting started](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/GettingStarted.md)
guide to install the eBPF for Windows components on a test-enabled Windows machine/VM.

### Building & Testing the extension

After cloning the repository, make sure to initialize the submodules by running the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
.\scripts\initialize_repo.ps1
```

Then, build the `ntosebpfext.sln` solution from the root of the repository, by running the following command:

```bash
msbuild ntosebpfext.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64
```

To regards of this extension, the following artifacts will be generated in the `x64\Debug` (in this case) directory:

- `netevent_ebpf_ext_export_program_info.exe` - A user-mode cmdlet that exports the eBPF program information to the eBPF store.
- `neteventebpfext.sys` - The driver that loads the eBPF program and attaches it to the network events.
- `nteevent_sim.sys` - The driver that simulates network events.
- `netevent_monitor.sys` - The native eBPF program that will be invoked by the `neteventebpfext` extension upon receiving network events,
which will store them in a ring-buffer map.
- `neteventebpfext_unit.exe` - An end-to-end unit test that includes a user-mode application that reads the network events from the ring buffer.
The test will generate network events using the `netevent_sim` driver, which will flow through the `neteventebpfext` extension and into the
`netevent_monitor` eBPF program, which will store the events in the ring buffer map.

#### Testing

To run the end-to-end unit test, you can use the `neteventebpfext_unit.exe` application as follows:

```bash
# Required only if the eBPF program information is not exported yet
netevent_ebpf_ext_export_program_info.exe

# Run the test with debugging enabled
neteventebpfext_unit.exe -d yes
```

This test will perform the following steps:

1. Export the eBPF program info to the eBPF Store (located in System's registry, under `HKCU\Software\eBPF`).
1. Load & start the `nteevent_sim.sys` driver.
1. Load & start the `neteventebpfext.sys` driver.
1. Load and attach the `netevent_monitor.sys` eBPF program.
1. Register a callback to read the network events from the ring buffer.
1. Display the network events generated by the `nteevent_sim` driver.
1. Stop and unload all the drivers.

## Installing the extension

Once generated the artifacts, to deploy the extension you need to:

- Export the eBPF program to the system's eBPF store using the `netevent_ebpf_ext_export_program_info.exe` application:

    ```bash
    netevent_ebpf_ext_export_program_info.exe --clear # Mainly, to clear-out any previous eBPF program information related to this program type.
    netevent_ebpf_ext_export_program_info.exe
    ```

- Load and start the `neteventebpfext.sys` eBPF extension driver which will enable loading eBPF programs of type `netevent_monitor`
and attaching the to the network event source:

    ```bash
    sc create neteventebpfext type=kernel start=demand binPath=neteventebpfext.sys
    sc start neteventebpfext
    ```

## Development

[eBPF for Windows Extensions](https://github.com/microsoft/ebpf-for-windows/blob/main/docs/eBpfExtensions.md) use
the [Network Module Registar (NMR)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/network-module-registrar2)
to interact with the eBPF programs (through eBPF Core), and NMR providers. The `neteventebpfext` extension is an implementation of
an Network Provider Interface (NPI) client that attaches to the network events sourced by providers its same NPI.

### Optimizing event handling in the `neteventebpfext` extension

The `neteventebpfext` extension can be optimized for well-defined use cases, where the maximum size of events is known.
In this case, enabling the `USE_STATIC_EVENT_BUFFER` preprocessor variable (i.e setting it to `1`) in `ebpf_extensions\neteventebpfext\netevent_ebpf_ext_event.c`,
will configure the extension to use a static buffer of size `STATIC_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE` bytes, instead of a dynamically allocated buffer.

```c
#define USE_STATIC_EVENT_BUFFER 0
#define STATIC_EVENT_BUFFER_SIZE 65536 ///< Tune to the maximum size of the event data, specific to the use case.
```

### Writing an eBPF program that attaches to the `neteventebpfext` extension

The simplest way to write an eBPF program that attaches to the network events is to review the `netevent_monitor.c` eBPF program that is
provided in the `\tools\netevent_monitor` project. This program will store the network events in a ring buffer map.

The Network Provider Interface (NPI) in `include\ebpf_netevent_hooks.h`defines the following structure for the network events:

```c
typedef struct
{
    unsigned char* event_data_start; ///< Pointer to start of the data associated with the event.
    unsigned char* event_data_end;   ///< Pointer to end of the data associated with the event (i.e. first byte *outside*
                                     ///< the memory range).
} netevent_event_info_t;
```

To write your own eBPF program, you must create your own project (similar to the `netevent_monitor` project) and define a section
of type `netevent_monitor` in your eBPF program. The `netevent_monitor` section is used by the `neteventebpfext` extension to attach
the eBPF program to the network events.

```c
#include "ebpf_helpers.h"
#include "ebpf_netevent_hooks.h" // For the netevent_event_md_t and netevent_event_hook_t definitions.

// Define any eBPF maps that you need here
struct
{
    //... my_map members
} my_map SEC(".maps");

// The following line is optional, but is used to verify
// that the MyNetEventHandler prototype is correct or the compiler
// would complain when the function is actually defined below.
netevent_event_hook_t MyNetEventHandler;

// Define the eBPF program that will be attached to the network events.
SEC("netevent_monitor")
int
MyNetEventHandler(netevent_event_md_t* ctx)
{
    // Your eBPF program logic here

    return 0;
}
```

The extension supports attaching multiple eBPF programs (as NPI clients), to which the network events will be dispatched.

### Writing an NMR provider that generates network events

Under `tools\netevent_sim`, you can find a simple NMR provider that generates demo network events, with detailed comments.
The provider is implemented as a native kernel driver and showcases how to register itself to the NMR as an NPI provider and generate network events using the NMR API through a configurable kernel timer.

In `ebpf_extensions\neteventebpfext\netevent_ebpf_ext_event.c` you can find the definition of NPIID to be used by the NMR provider,
along with the dispatch table exported by the eBPF extension as an NMR client:

```c
const NPIID netevent_npiid = {0x2227e819, 0x8d8b, 0x11d4, {0xab, 0xad, 0x00, 0x90, 0x27, 0x71, 0x9e, 0x09}};
```

The dispatch table for the network events provider is defined in `ebpf_extensions\neteventebpfext\netevent_ebpf_ext_event.c` as follows:

```c
typedef struct _ebpf_helper_function_addresses
{
    ebpf_extension_header_t header;  ///< Common eBPF For Windows Extension header.
    UINT32 helper_function_count;    ///< Number of helper functions in the dispatch table.
    UINT64* helper_function_address; ///< Array of helper function addresses.
} ebpf_helper_function_addresses_t;
```

Currently, the `neteventebpfext` extension supports the following helper function (which will so be the only element in the `helper_function_address` array):

```c
void _ebpf_netevent_push_event(_In_ netevent_event_md_t* netevent_event)
```

This function will dispatch the network event to all the eBPF programs attached to the extension.
